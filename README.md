# Animated_ddp
This code was for a project that I had for my classical mechanics class. The goal of the project was to look at the differential equation governing 
the motion of a driven damped pendulum. All the code is made by me.

The code for the animation is reurposed from https://scipython.com/book2/chapter-7-matplotlib/problems/p77/animating-a-pendulum/
